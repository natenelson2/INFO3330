# PREIshare Investor Dashboard — Information Architecture

## Purpose
Map of investor-facing pages for the dashboard shell (mock data only).
No auth flows, admin tools, or live API contracts in this sprint.

Source brief: docs/investor-dashboard-brief.md.

## URL map and page purposes

| URL path | Route name | Nav label | Page purpose | Primary content |
|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| /dashboard | Dashboard home | Home | Quick scan of portfolio value and activity | Stats row, portfolio summary, recent activity |
| /dashboard/portfolio | Portfolio | Portfolio | Review holdings at a glance | Portfolio table (mock rows) |
| /dashboard/deals | Deals | Deals | See open / featured deals | Deals list (mock cards or rows) |
| /dashboard/profile | Profile | Profile | View member profile details | Profile card (mock member fields) |

## Navigation rules
- Shared chrome: left sidebar (desktop) + top header; main content on the right/below.
- Active nav item should match the current URL path.
- Labels stay short and investor-friendly (Home, Portfolio, Deals, Profile).
- Nested under /dashboard so a parent layout can wrap all investor pages.
- Nav labels and paths live in one config (navConfig); Sidebar renders them.

## Out of scope for this shell
- Sign-in / sign-up pages
- Live Supabase queries
- Admin or sponsor tools
- Payments or document vaults
- Settings, messages, or extra investor pages beyond the four above

## Notes for later route files
Parent layout route: dashboard
Child routes: index (home), portfolio, deals, profile
